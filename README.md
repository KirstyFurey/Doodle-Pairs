# Doodle Pairs
## _JavaScript Matching Pairs Game_

Welcome to Doodle Pairs, a JavaScript dependant matching pairs game.
</br>
The premise of the game is simple, turn over cards to match them and clear the board.
</br>
The site will utilise HTML and CSS for the content and appearance, while the logic of the game will be written with JavaScript. 
</br>
</br>

## UX ##
My aim is to keep this site clean looking. I created these wireframes as a guide to how the site will look.
</br>
The site will be built primarily for mobile devices. The look and functionality will be retained on desktop, with the tiles being slightly larger.

### Deployment ###
To host the site on GitHub Pages, I followed the steps below:
1. Loaded Terminal
2. Created a local Git repository for the project using the command `git init` 
3. Added all files to the local repository using the command `git add .`
4. Commited files to the local repository using the command `git commit -m "commit comment"`
5. Create a remote repository on GitHub matching the name of my project
6. Copied the remote repository link and added to the command `git remote add origin (link)` in Terminal
7. Run command `git-remote -v` to ensure remote and local repositories are linked (returns push and fetch messages if they are)
8. Run command `git push origin master`
9. Repeat steps 3, 4, and 8 regularly throughout the project to keep repositories up to date and enable rollback, testing, and updates.
10. Navigated to my project repository on GitHub, then to 'Settings' and 'Pages'
11. Selected the master branch and saved to create the live link via GitHub pages.

### HTML Validation ###
I used *https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input* to validate the HTML code

### CSS Validation ###
I used *https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input* to validate my CSS.

### Accessibility Validation ###
I used *https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/* to check the contrast of text on my site.
</br>
To pass this test, colours need to have a contrast ratio of 4.5\:1 for normal text, and 3\:1 for large text.
</br>
The most common colour combinations on site are:
